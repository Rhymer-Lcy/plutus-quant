"""Atomic on-disk writes: write to a temp sibling, then os.replace() onto the final path.

os.replace() is an atomic same-volume rename on NTFS and POSIX, so a crash, scheduler
timeout, or machine sleep mid-write can never leave a truncated file that wedges every
later read. This matters for the unattended daily driver, whose multi-name pull is a
multi-minute write window. (Carried over from the sibling hermes-quant project.)
