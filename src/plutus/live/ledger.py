"""Idempotent performance ledger.

Principle: the running ledger is ALWAYS recomputed from an immutable seed plus every folded
day, so re-running a day is idempotent and the equity curve / trade log is fully
reproducible. Never mutate accumulated state in place.

The DECISIONS (which names, what target shares, fills) come from the SAME research engine
used in backtesting (see live.paper) -- the ledger only records and values them, so paper
trading cannot drift from research. Market-agnostic — carried over from hermes-quant.
